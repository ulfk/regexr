RegExr
======

# About
This is a fork of the project [gskinner/regexr](https://github.com/gskinner/regexr).

After I noticed that the page https://regexr.com went offline, I wanted to get this cool tool back and tried to get it running locally. Needed to update several packages and do some minor fixes.

This is WIP to understand the project and adapt it, remove adds etc.

# License
This version of RegExr is licensed under GPL v3 (as the original project is).

# Build
RegExr uses Gulp to manage the build process. You will need to install Node and Gulp, and install other dependencies via `npm install`. 

Running `gulp` (default) will run dev builds and set up a test server.
