RegExr
======

# About
This is a fork of the project [gskinner/regexr](https://github.com/gskinner/regexr).

After I noticed that the page https://regexr.com went offline, I wanted to get this cool tool back and tried to get it running locally. Needed to update several packages and do some minor fixes.

# License
This version of RegExr is licensed under GPL v3 (as the original project is).

# Build
RegExr uses Gulp to manage the build process. You will need to install Node and Gulp, and install other dependencies via `npm install`. Running `gulp` (default) will run dev builds and set up a test server.
